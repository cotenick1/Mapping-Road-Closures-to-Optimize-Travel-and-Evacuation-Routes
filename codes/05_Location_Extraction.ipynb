SpaCy has a number of interesting applications but broadly speaking, the platform allows us to extract a broad array of information and meaning from individual words and strings.  In this case, we are most interested in its features of Named Entity Recognition (which, per the spaCy documentation, allows for identification of \"real-world\" items including locations) and Text Classification, which can assign labels to various pieces of text.  We can train the model based on snippets of text we provide.  Please see key features in the following link: https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101"
